    <h2>Objectives & Scope</h2>
    <p>Detect license plates from static and live images; extract readable alphanumeric content; support Indian and foreign formats; and display real-time recognition in a user-friendly web interface.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>The final implementation integrates SSD MobileNet for detection, EasyOCR for character recognition, and Flask for web interfacing. Users can upload images or activate a live camera feed to run detections, which are rendered dynamically on the website.</p>

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>OCR issues on low-quality images resolved using EasyOCR</li>
      <li>Live detection and web sync handled using Python threading</li>
      <li>Foreign plate formats supported by relaxing character filters</li>
    </ul>
